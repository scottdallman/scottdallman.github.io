### _*The Effect of Opioid Abuse on Child Out-of-Home Placements — JOB MARKET PAPER*_ 

Opioid abuse has become a major public health issue in the US. While opioid misuse has direct consequences for addicts, children may also be affected. To prevent misuse of the prescription opiate OxyContin, Purdue Pharma released an abuse-deterrent version in 2010. Unintentionally, this reformulation caused many addicted to OxyContin to substitute more harmful opioids such as heroin and fentanyl in its place.

This study estimates the effect of opioid abuse on child out-of-home placements, the removal of a child from home due to maltreatment, using data on opioid abuse and OxyContin's reformulation. Using the reformulation as an instrumental variable for opioid abuse rates, I estimate that a one percent increase in the opioid abuse treatment admission rate caused an additional 2.4 foster care entries per 100,000 children due to drug abuse -- equivalent to 1,778.4 child foster care out-of-home placements nationally. An average 27.21% increase in the opioid abuse treatment admissions rate over the study period was equivalent to 4,840 additional drug-related child out-of-home placements or $26M in additional costs to the US foster care system from 2006-2016. Given the national increase in child out-of-home placements due to parental drug abuse, additional resources should be targeted towards these households to reduce the social cost of child maltreatment.

### [_*The Effect of Constitutional Provisions on Education Policy and Outcomes*_](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr623.pdf) (with Anusha Nath and Filip Premik). April 26, 2021. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Staff Report 623.

Education services in the United States are determined predominantly by non-market institutions, the rules of which are defined by state constitutions. This paper empirically examines the effect of changes in constitutional provisions on education outcomes in the United States. To show causal effects, we exploit discontinuities in the procedure for adopting constitutional amendments to compare outcomes when an amendment passed with those when an amendment failed. Our results show that adoption of an amendment results in higher per-pupil expenditure, higher teacher salaries, smaller class size, and improvements in reading and math test scores. We examine the underlying mechanism driving these results by studying the actions of the legislature and the courts after an amendment is passed. We find that, on average, the legislature responds with a one-year lag in enacting education policies satisfying the minimum standards imposed by the amendment, and there is no increase in the number of education cases reaching appellate courts. Using school finance reforms, we also show that in situations where the legislature fails to enact education policies, courts intervene to enforce constitutional standards to improve outcomes. This enforcement mechanism is more impactful in states that have higher constitutional minimum standards. Taken together, the causal effects on education outcomes and the patterns in legislative bill enactments and court cases provide a novel test of the hypothesis that a strong constitutional provision improves the bargaining position of citizens vis-à-vis that of elected leaders. If citizens do not receive education services as mandated in the constitution, they can seek remedy in court.

### [_*Education Clauses in State Constitutions Across the United States*_](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/~/media/assets/articles/2020/education-clauses-in-state-constitutions-across-the-united-states/education-clauses-in-state-constitutions-across-the-united-states.pdf?la=en) (with Anusha Nath).  January 8th, 2020.  Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Policy Brief. 

This article documents the variation in strength of education clauses in state constitutions across the United States. The U.S. Constitution is silent on the subject of education, but every state constitution includes language that mandates the establishment of a public education system. Some state constitutions include clauses that only stipulate that the state provide public education, while other states have taken more significant measures to ensure the provision of a high-quality public education system. 

Constitutional language matters. We use Florida and Louisiana as case studies to illustrate that constitutional amendments can be drivers of change. Institutional changes to the education system that citizens of Florida and Louisiana helped create ultimately led to improved outcomes for their children.
