### [_The Effect of Opioid Abuse on Child Out-of-Home Placements — JOB MARKET PAPER_](/images/JMP_ScottDallman.pdf)

Opioid abuse has become a major public health issue in the US. While opioid misuse has direct consequences for addicts, children may also be affected. To prevent misuse of the prescription opiate OxyContin, Purdue Pharma released an abuse-deterrent version in 2010. Unintentionally, this reformulation caused many addicted to OxyContin to substitute more harmful opioids such as heroin and fentanyl in its place.

This study estimates the effect of opioid abuse on child out-of-home placements, the removal of a child from home due to maltreatment, using data on opioid abuse and OxyContin's reformulation. Using the reformulation as an instrumental variable for opioid abuse rates, I estimate that a one percent increase in the opioid abuse treatment admission rate caused an additional 2.4 foster care entries per 100,000 children due to drug abuse -- equivalent to 1,778.4 child foster care out-of-home placements nationally. An average 27.21% increase in the opioid abuse treatment admissions rate over the study period was equivalent to 4,840 additional drug-related child out-of-home placements or $26M in additional costs to the US foster care system from 2006-2016. Given the national increase in child out-of-home placements due to parental drug abuse, additional resources should be targeted towards these households to reduce the social cost of child maltreatment.
